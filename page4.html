                <p>If you love peaches but just can’t get past the fuzzy skin, you’ll love Babcock peaches. Their smooth skin is quite appealing, although they are a smaller variety.
                    Taste-wise, Babcock peaches have a lovely balance of sweet and tangy flavors.</p>

                <p>The name might be a bit extreme, but essentially, Melting Flesh peaches have flesh that falls right off the inner peach. While this is convenient, the downside is that the flesh can become very soft and even soggy quite quickly.
                    As long as they are handled delicately, Melting Flesh peaches are great in desserts such as pies.</p>

                <p>Honey Babe peaches are on the small size, they are still quite sweet. They have a nice, yellow flesh with very little acidity</p>

                <img src="40niner.PNG" alt="Species 4"title="FORTY-NINER PEACHES">
                <p>Grown in California, Forty-Niner peaches are one of the largest varieties. They are quite delicate, so you want to take care when handling them.
                    Forty-Niner Peaches have a yellow skin and are not overly sweet.</p>

                <img src="cardinal.PNG" alt="Species 5"title="CARDINAL PEACHES">
                <p>Similar to the famous birds, Cardinal peaches have a bright red skin with lovely yellow accents. They are sweet, but not overly so, and inside, the peach flesh is nice and firm.
                    </p>

                <img src="white flash.PNG" alt="Species 6"title="WHITE FLESH PEACHES">
                <p>Yes, White Flesh peaches have white flesh inside of them. While the peaches are whiter near the skin, the flesh does turn to a dark pink closer to the pit.
                    White Flesh peaches are sweet and not too acidic. They are often found growing in Asia.
