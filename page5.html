            <h2>Heart Health</h2>
            <p>All types of fruits are an important part of a heart-healthy diet, but peaches might have some specific benefits. Research in animal studies has found that peach extract can help lower cholesterol and high blood pressure. Peaches are also a moderate source of potassium, which is an important nutrient to help control blood pressure.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Improved Digestion</h2>
            <p>“Peaches contain both soluble and insoluble fiber,” Smith says. “Soluble fiber helps stabilize blood sugar and keeps cholesterol levels in check. Insoluble fiber aids in digestion and helps prevent constipation.” Eating the skin of the fruit can maximize your fiber intake. Besides the goodness of fiber, peaches may keep your belly happy in other ways, too. Some research suggests that tea and extracts made from peach flowers may help improve digestion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Decreased Inflammation</h2>
            <p>The plant-based polyphenols (micronutrients) and prebiotics (live bacteria) that are found in peaches and other plant-based foods can decrease inflammation, which can, in turn, decrease your risk of many chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Stronger Immune System</h2>
            <p>The fuzzy skin and juicy flesh of peaches contain good-for-you antioxidants, including vitamin C, polyphenols, and carotenoids. Antioxidants are compounds in plants that fight cell damage, and antioxidant-rich diets can help protect your body against aging and illnesses, including cancer. In fact, scientists have found that postmenopausal women who ate at least two servings of peaches a week had lower rates of certain types of breast cancer. Some research also found that extracts from peach pits might dial down the body’s allergic response. More research is needed, but it’s an intriguing hint that peaches might benefit the immune system in a variety of ways.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Healthy Eyes</h2>
            <p>“Peaches are a moderate source of beta carotene, a red-orange pigment found in fruits,” Smith says. The body turns beta carotene into vitamin A, an essential vitamin that’s important for healthy vision.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Smoother Skin</h2>
            <p>Some lab research found that when applied to the skin, extracts made from peach pits or peach flowers might reduce UV damage and help skin retain moisture. More research is needed, but it’s another possible reason to love peaches.</p>
