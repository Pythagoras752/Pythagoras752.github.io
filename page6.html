<p id="p6"><b>Whether you use them in desserts or savory dishes, peaches are a fantastic way to add fresh,
     fruity flavor and juicy, mouthwatering texture in every bite.
      From summer salads to homemade peach cobbler, peaches are a versatile fruit that can punch up every recipe,
       including cocktails. If you’re not a fan of their fuzzy skin you can either peel them or substitute nectarines—peaches and nectarines can be used interchangeably in many recipes. 
       Whatever you choose, these recipes will help you make the most your summer bounty, starting with this simple salad that puts the beloved fruit on full display.
        The sweet flavor of the peaches is complemented by the savory red onion. Fresh basil and mint add extra depth of flavor, and crunchy candied nuts add texture.
         Top with a simple honey Dijon vinaigrette and serve. Here are our best Recipies
